## Description
MERN app to track my vinyl record collection. The list of records is stored in MongoDB, with the album art and record information retreived from Discogs. To add a new record, I type in the UPC code, which then is used to pull the record information form Discogs. Since there are multiple entries from Discogs for a given UPC, I then choose which Discogs entry is the closest match. [Live site here](http://vinyls.rytc.io)
